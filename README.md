<h2> Welcome to my GitHub </h2>
<p>
  Here I showcase projects in the fields of Data Science and Full Stack Web Development. These are not just my areas of expertise but also my passion and professional calling.<br /><br />
  My primary goal is to devise intelligent solutions that enhance the operational efficiency of various departments within an organization, with a particular emphasis on data and tool intelligence. My vision is to empower employees by freeing them from repetitive tasks such as data collection, spreadsheet management, and juggling multiple tools simultaneously. Instead, my aim is to enable them to focus on a singular mission: delivering value to clients.<br /><br />
  I am deeply committed to being both data-driven and customer-centric, with a strong alignment to BizOps principles. My core focus is on refining the company's products to be not only appealing but also highly functional for clients. However, I recognize that this goal can only be achieved by fostering an environment that encourages operational efficiency, driving the growth and development of employees.<br /><br />
  I am dedicated to helping teams become exponentially more efficient and believe that my multifaceted approach is the key to achieving this goal. Feel free to connect with me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/wallacypasqualini/">LinkedIn</a> and explore my expertise through the projects published in my <a href="https://github.com/WallPasq?tab=repositories">repositories</a>.
